    <p class="para1">Formerly used to keep rodents and vermin away from food stores, the American Shorthair still enjoys
      exercising her
      hunting skills on unsuspecting insects.</p>

    <p class="para2">As a smart, moderately active feline, she enjoys learning tricks and challenging
      her intelligence with puzzles and interactive toys.</p>

        <h1>Temperament</h1>

        <p>She’s adaptable and good-natured, which makes her the ideal family companion. Although she loves attention
          from her
          people, including children, the American Shorthair does not like being carried and is fairly independent. She
          may curl
          up in your lap on occasion, but she may prefer to sit alongside you instead.</p>

        <h1>Colors</h1>

        <p>American Shorthairs are a diverse breed with an array of colors and patterns. Silver tabby is one of the most
          common and
          popular, however.</p>

        <h1>Health</h1>

        <p>The American Shorthair is a hearty and healthy breed. Some instances of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy have been
          recorded,
          but it’s unknown if the condition is hereditary. Their flat face also makes the breed more susceptible to
          ocular and
          respiratory issues. They are genetically predisposed to mouth and gum disease and their laid-back nature
          increases their
          risk of obesity. Reputable breeders test thoroughly to avoid breeding cats with genetic diseases.</p>

        <h1>Choosing the Best Food for American Shorthair Cats</h1>

        <p>Because American Shorthairs are generally healthy, a complete and balanced cat food should be sufficient for
          their
          needs. If your American puts on weight due to inactivity, however, you may want to consider a healthy weight
          formula
          like Purina Pro Plan Focus Adult Weight Management Formula or Purina ONE Healthy Metabolism, and if she
          regularly
          develops hairballs, consider a specially formulated cat food to help control them, such as Purina Pro Plan
          Focus
          Hairball Management Chicken & Rice Formula.
